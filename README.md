# Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) Project
This project uses a JDBC driver to connect a Java-based client to a MySQL database depicting a library with books, publishers, and writing groups.

The .grab files represent the table structures needed to create the database for this project. Given where the database is stored on one's hard disk, the value for DB_URL might need to change in the JDBCproj_v2 file.
